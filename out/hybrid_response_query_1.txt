Knowledge graphs help with multi-hop queries by enabling the traversal of multiple relationships within the graph. This allows the system to combine both semantic and structural information to provide comprehensive and accurate responses. By leveraging the interconnected entities and relationships, knowledge graphs facilitate complex reasoning paths, making it possible to answer intricate, multi-step queries effectively.
