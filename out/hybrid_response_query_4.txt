The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KG) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves response accuracy by combining structured graph-based retrieval with vector-based semantic search. This hybrid approach leverages the explicit relationships in the knowledge graph to provide context-aware and factually accurate responses, reducing errors and hallucinations. Additionally, RAG grounds responses in verified external knowledge sources, ensuring up-to-date and reliable information. The integration also enables multi-hop reasoning, allowing for comprehensive answers to complex queries by traversing multiple relationships in the graph.
