The integration of Knowledge Graphs with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) has broad applications across various domains, including:

1. **Question Answering Systems**: Answering complex, multi-hop questions by traversing the knowledge graph and providing structured reasoning paths.
2. **Recommendation Engines**: Modeling explicit relationships between users, items, and preferences to deliver personalized recommendations.
3. **Information Retrieval**: Combining semantic search with structured querying for more accurate results and handling ambiguous queries.
4. **Knowledge-Based Chatbots**: Grounding responses in verified knowledge sources for factual, context-aware interactions.
5. **Healthcare and Life Sciences**: Modeling relationships between diseases, symptoms, and treatments to assist in diagnosis and drug discovery.
6. **Financial Services**: Analyzing relationships between companies, markets, and economic indicators to support decision-making with structured insights.
