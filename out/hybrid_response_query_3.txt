Scaling knowledge graphs presents several technical challenges, including:

1. **Optimizing Graph Traversal and Embedding Techniques**: Ensuring efficient navigation and representation for graphs with millions of entities.
2. **Efficient Storage and Retrieval**: Managing large-scale graphs to maintain performance.
3. **Handling Inconsistencies**: Addressing discrepancies between text-based and graph-based representations.
4. **Balancing Precision and Recall**: Developing hybrid ranking algorithms to balance high precision of graph queries with high recall of vector similarity search.
5. **Combining Results Efficiently**: Designing fusion methods to aggregate results from graph traversal and vector search for comprehensive outputs.
